	purpose: {To show how to simulate an arrays in Flash 4 using EVAL function}
	comment: {
	In Flash 4, the eval function was used to simulate an arrays. In Flash 5 it is recommended that you use the Array object to create arrays. That's already posible in the Rebol/Flash dialect using:
	b: make block! ["a" "b" "c"]
	x: "[" add b/1 add " " add b/2 add " " add b/3 add "]"

	<b>About joining strings:</b>
	it's posible to use the <b>&</b> char as it's in ActionScript or a dot (<b>.</b>) as it's in PHP
	}
